# AC-GANS-FOR-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
These are the architectures for the AC-GAN and baseline models that we constructed for the manuscript "Investigating the Potential of Auxiliary-Classifier GANs for Image Classification in Low Data Regimes".
AlexNet was used for the CIFAR10 experiments, and another standard CNN model was used for the Fashion-MNIST and COVID-19 tests. The discriminators of the AC-GANs are based off these corresponding classifier networks.
