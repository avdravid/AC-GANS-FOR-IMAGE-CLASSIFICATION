# Improved-Methods-for-Auxilary-Classifier-GAN-Image-Classification
These are the architectures for the AC-GAN and baseline models that we constructed for the manuscript "Improved Methods for Auxilary-Classifier GAN Image Classification".
AlexNet was used for the CIFAR10 experiments, and another standard CNN model was used for the Fashion-MNIST tests. The discriminators of the AC-GANs are based off these corresponding
classifier networks.
